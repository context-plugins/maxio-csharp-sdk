    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum, must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:
    /// </para>
    /// <code>
    /// {
    ///   "invoice": {
    ///     "line_items": [
    ///       {
    ///         "title": "A Product",
    ///         "quantity": 12,
    ///         "unit_price": "150.00"
    ///       }
    ///     ]
    ///   }
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// <para>
    /// ### Catalog items
    /// Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like products, components.
    /// </para>
    /// <code>
    /// {
    ///   "invoice": {
    ///     "line_items": [

    ///   }
    /// }

    ///
    /// The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line items can be sent.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// ### Line item types
    /// When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item:
    /// #### Custom item
    /// As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass <c>title</c> and <c>unit_price</c> for custom item.
    /// #### Product id
    /// Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with <c>product_id</c>. By default <c>unit_price</c> is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing <c>unit_price</c> or <c>product_price_point_id</c>. If <c>product_id</c> is used, following fields cannot be used: <c>title</c>, <c>component_id</c>.
    /// #### Component id
    /// Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with <c>component_id</c>. If <c>component_id</c> is used, following fields cannot be used: <c>title</c>, <c>product_id</c>. By default <c>unit_price</c> is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing <c>unit_price</c> or <c>price_point_id</c>. At this moment price points are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing components <c>unit_price</c> is required.
